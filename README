= Carousel

A rotating banner for Radiant extensions. Based on "Infinite Carousel" by CatchMyFame.com and includes JQuery (http://www.catchmyfame.com/catchmyfame-jquery-plugins/). Version 1.2.2 of Infinite Carousel. (not latest, by the way).


To Install
1. In your vendor/extensions directory, enter:
git clone git@github.com:banane/radiant-carousel-extension.git carousel

2. In your radiant root, do the following to upload a set of photos from a local directory:
rake radiant:extensions:carousel:copy_images

3. You will be prompted for your local directory. Once you enter that, all of the file will be copied to a  publicly viewable directory for Carousel to read from (and do the HTML mark-up for you.)

NOTE: You can manually move images files to the directory /vendor/extensions/carousel/public/images/carousel if they are in various locaitons. You can also re-run the copy images rake task to add to the directory.

4. In your radiant root directory, enter:
rake radiant:extensions:carousel:update

5. In the Radiant Admin UI interface, go to the page where you want the carousel. Now, have a choice of enumerating each image, or using the batch tag.

4a. Enumerated image tag "<r:carousel />". Use the Carousel tag to specify each image up to 3. Use attributes: picture_1="", picture_2="", picture_3="" and caption_1,2,3, etc. 

Alternatively, you can use <r:carousel_batch /> tag. This tag doesn't have any options.

<r:carousel_batch />

5. Lastly, make sure the layout that your page is using has the following HTML tags in its header, in this order. Change [your root directory] to your domain, such as "http://www.acme.com/." The files stem from the public (main) directory on your web server.
