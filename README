To Install
1. In your vendor/extensions directory, enter:
git clone git@github.com:banane/radiant-carousel-extension.git carousel

2. OPTIONAL: You can copy images to a radiant public image directory by typing, in your Radiant root:
rake radiant:extensions:carousel:copy_images

3. (back to required steps) In your radiant root directory, enter:
rake radiant:extensions:carousel:update

4. In the Radiant Admin UI interface, use the following tags:
<r:carousel>
<r:carousel_image link="[link target for this image]" src="[path to image- use Mediamaid and click the title of the picture to insert]" caption="[the caption for the panel]" />
... iterate through as many carousel images as you want.
</r:carousel>

5. Lastly, make sure the layout that your page is using has the following HTML tags in its header, in this order. Change [your root directory] to your domain, such as "http://www.acme.com/." The files stem from the public (main) directory on your web server.
